# DipoleFitting_Figures
MATLAB figures for error maps and thicknesses in the paper: Accuracy of EEG dipole source reconstruction in the 3-layer BEM model against the 5-layer BEM-FMM model

Each folder corresponds to a subject.

The following are descriptions for each file

<subject>_fit_plot.fig -- Interpolated error map (mm) on grey matter surface
<subject>_fit_plot_SKIN.fig -- Interpolated error map (mm) on GM inflated to skin surface 
<subject>_thickness_<tissue>.fig -- Interpolated thickness map on GM shell (for GM and CSF thickness), BONE shell (for BONE thickness), and SKIN shell (for SKIN thickness)
<subject>_thickness_<tissue>_SKIN.fig -- Interpolated thickness map as in the previous line, but inflated to skin surface.
